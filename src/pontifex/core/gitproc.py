"""A bounded runner for a git subprocess whose stdout must be streamed rather than
captured whole.

CLI-agnostic; no parent-package imports (keeps ``_core`` extractable). It exists so a
count over a repo-cardinality git listing (``ls-tree``, ``diff --numstat``,
``ls-files``) stays O(one line + one chunk) in memory regardless of how many entries
the workspace has, instead of materializing the whole output via
``subprocess.run(capture_output=True)``.

The process lifecycle is ported verbatim in spirit from
``gitdiff._stream_redacted_diff`` — that code paid for these guarantees in several
subtle bug fixes, and a second, weaker copy would silently regress them:

- ``start_new_session=True`` so the child is its own process-group leader, and a
  timeout kills the *group* (``killpg(proc.pid)``) — reaching a grandchild that
  inherited and still holds the stdout pipe. ``proc.pid`` is used directly as the pgid
  rather than ``os.getpgid`` because on macOS ``getpgid`` raises ``ESRCH`` on a zombie
  leader while the group is still live.
- A kill/reap lock plus a ``_finished`` flag so the watchdog ``Timer`` can never signal
  a already-reaped (and possibly reused) PID.
- stderr drained **concurrently** on a thread under a byte cap. A post-EOF read would
  deadlock if git filled the >64 KiB stderr pipe before the caller drained stdout; the
  concurrent drain removes that condition while bounding retained bytes.
- A deadline-bounded wait that still kills the group if the child closed stdout but
  stayed alive, or a descendant holds a pipe open past EOF.

The caller supplies the full argv (``["git", *hardening_flags, *args]``) and env, so
this module carries no project config or git-hardening policy of its own.
