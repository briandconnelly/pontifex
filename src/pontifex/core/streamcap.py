"""Bounded streaming primitives shared by the subprocess runtime and diff gather.

CLI-agnostic; no parent-package imports. Three tools:

- ``iter_bounded_lines`` reads a text stream in fixed chunks and yields complete
  lines, capping any single logical line so a pathological producer cannot buffer
  an unbounded line into memory before a newline arrives. Lines are kept whole up
  to ``max_line_bytes``; a single logical line that exceeds the cap is truncated
  mid-line with a ``…[line truncated]`` marker (so a pathologically long JSONL
  line may not parse, but normal-sized lines are preserved intact).
  **It drains to EOF and must never back an interactive stream** — see its docstring.
- ``iter_bounded_lines_interactive`` applies the same bounding to a *binary* stream
  read via ``read1``, so a line surfaces as soon as its newline arrives rather than
  when the producer exits. Use it for request/response protocols over a live pipe.
- ``BoundedCapture`` accumulates lines under a byte budget, keeping a head window
  plus a bounded tail so the newest lines (where agent CLIs emit usage/rate-limit
  metadata) survive truncation. Complete lines only. ``head_bytes=0`` drops the head
  window for a pure rolling tail. It is thread-safe: a reader may snapshot it while a
  writer thread is still filling it.

Both readers share ``_assemble_bounded_lines``; they differ only in the chunk source,
which is the whole of the drain/interactive distinction. Keeping the truncation and
pending-line logic in one place is deliberate: it has been the site of several subtle
bugs (see the regression tests in ``tests/test_gitdiff.py``), and a second copy would
let them diverge.

    exceeded ``max_bytes``.  Truncation (and the marker) occur only when output
    actually exceeds the cap and a line is dropped; retained bytes never exceed
    ``max_bytes`` plus the marker.  Complete lines only.

    ``head_bytes`` overrides the head window (default: half of ``max_bytes``) and must lie
    in ``0..max_bytes``.  Pass ``head_bytes=0`` for a **pure rolling tail** — no head
    window, so the marker leads and only the newest lines survive.  That is the right
    shape when the diagnostic value is at the *end* of the stream (a stack trace that

    budget above ``max_bytes`` would let the head grow past the ceiling with ``truncated``
    still ``False`` — silently violating the guarantee instead of enforcing it.  Rejected
    at construction rather than clamped: it can only be a programming error.

    **Thread-safe.**  ``add()`` and ``result()`` are serialized, so a reader may snapshot
    a capture that a writer thread is still filling.  ``add()`` mutates a list, a deque
    and three counters across several statements; the GIL makes each statement atomic but
    not the sequence, so an unlocked ``result()`` can observe a pre-eviction over-budget
    state, disagree with the ``truncated`` flag, or raise ``RuntimeError: deque mutated
    during iteration`` — on the very error path trying to report a failure.  The lock is
    held only for bounded in-memory work, never across a blocking read.  Note that a
