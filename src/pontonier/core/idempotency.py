"""Disk-backed idempotency index for spend-committing runs (CLI-agnostic, _core).

A client passes an ``idempotency_key`` with a run; the index lets a retry after a
transport drop **replay** an existing run instead of starting (and paying for) a
duplicate. It sits beside the :class:`~pontonier.core.jobs.JobStore` and is
driven by it — stdlib only, and (like everything in ``_core``) it never imports from
the parent package.

Dedup identity is (workspace, tool, argument-hash): the index lives in a per-workspace
directory the store owns, entries are keyed by ``sha256([tool, key])``, and each entry
records the ``arg_hash`` so the same key reused with *different* effective arguments is
a stable conflict rather than a mismatched replay.

Cross-process safety rests on ``O_EXCL``: exactly one creator wins a given entry. The
loser reads the winner's record and classifies it (replay / conflict / result-gone /
in-progress). A reserved-but-unpublished entry is treated as *in progress* and fails
closed — never silently re-run — until a conservative horizon has passed, after which
it is swept. There is deliberately no short-grace reclaim: a re-stat is not a
compare-and-delete, so a paused reserver could still publish, and reclaiming early
could double-spend.
