# Left unbounded, that peek made the guard quadratic on repeated-anchor input the same way
# #439's JWT segment was (that bound is defined further below, at the JWT entry in
# `SECRET_VALUE_PATTERNS`): matching an open-ended run costs O(remaining) even with no
# backtracking, and the guard is evaluated at every one of a repeated anchor's
# occurrences, so `("key=", N)` summed that cost across ~N positions — O(N^2). Measured on
# the unbounded guard: `"key="*20000` (80k chars) 3.5s, `"key="*40000` (160k) 14.2s, ~4x
# per 2x input.
#
# This bound applies ONLY to the non-bracket branch. The bracketed branch (below, the
# `(?(key_bracket)...)` conditional) stays genuinely UNBOUNDED — restoring #434's shipped
# guarantee exactly, with no cap and no distance limit — and is still flat on the hostile
# seed for a structural reason rather than a numeric one: on `"key="*N`, `key_bracket` is
# false at EVERY anchor (there is no bracket anywhere in that text), so the unbounded
# conditional branch never evaluates at all — only this O(cap) branch runs, giving O(N).
# On a text built from repeated BRACKETED anchors (`'x["key"]= ' * N`, the seed this
# guard's own conditional branch is actually exposed to), the branch is flat for a
# different reason: `key_bracket` requires consuming a quote and a `]`, and both are
# outside `_VALUE_CHARS`, so the unbounded probe run FROM one bracketed anchor is
# terminated (by hitting a quote/bracket char the value class can't cross) before the NEXT
# bracketed anchor can even begin — no probe run can span two bracketed anchors, so the
# per-anchor cost cannot compound across anchors the way an uncapped non-bracket peek did.
# Measured (`'x["key"]= ' * N`): 5000 reps (50k chars) 0.007s, 10000 (100k) 0.014s, 20000
# (200k) 0.029s, 40000 (400k) 0.057s — linear, ~2x per 2x input, both branches together
# proven flat by `test_repeated_anchor_input_is_not_quadratic_for_any_pattern` and a
# second, bracket-anchor-seeded timing test alongside it.
#
# The value-length probe on BOTH branches is an EXACT `_MIN_SECRET_VALUE_LEN` rather than
# an open `{16,}` — the guard only asks a yes/no question ("is the inner value at least
# this long"), which a fixed count answers identically (both accept exactly when 16+
# matching chars exist) at O(16) instead of O(remaining); this is what keeps the
# UNBOUNDED bracketed branch itself flat per-anchor once it reaches a candidate inner
# label, independent of the peek-cap question above, which is about how far it can reach
# in the first place.
#
# 1024 rather than a smaller cap: measured (`"key="*20000`, the mandated anti-quadratic
# seed) at 256 -> 0.034s, 1024 -> 0.103s, 4096 -> 0.366s, confirming the cost scales
# linearly in the cap (not just in input length) — so the cap itself, not only the
# bound's existence, has to be chosen deliberately. 1024 is 2x the JWT first-segment
# bound (512, chosen for real JOSE headers ~20-60 chars, ~120 with `kid`/`jku`) and >12x
# the widest peek distance any fixture in the swallow suites below (:2300-2358,
# `test_labelled_match_does_not_swallow_a_later_sensitive_label`) exercises (under 80
# chars), while still leaving ~20x headroom under the 2.0s anti-quadratic budget on this
# machine — 4096's ~5.5x margin was judged too thin for a slower CI runner, the same
# reasoning `test_repeated_anchor_input_is_not_quadratic_for_any_pattern`'s own module
# comment applies to the JWT rep count.
#
# Because the bracketed branch is unbounded, this cap is NOT a narrowing of anything main
# ever shipped: main's bracket-conditional guard is preserved byte-for-byte in reach (see
# the conditional branch below), so every input it protected is still protected, at any
# distance. What the cap bounds is exclusively the NEW non-bracket coverage #436 adds —
# main had zero protection there at ANY distance, so capping it at 1024 is a partial fix
# of a pre-existing leak, not a regression: a non-bracket swallow chain whose gap exceeds
# 1024 chars remains exactly as unprotected as it always was on every released version.
# Pinned at the exact cliff by `test_non_bracket_swallow_guard_peek_boundary_is_pinned`.

# The connection-string userinfo matchers, named rather than left anonymous in the list
# below. Their contract is one-directional BY DEFAULT — a change may widen what is
# recognized, never narrow it, EXCEPT under an explicit, characterized trade weighed
# against a documented false-positive cost (see #442 below, which does exactly that) —
# and the differential sweep that enforces the default has to substitute one of them to
# prove it can still see a loss. Addressing them by list POSITION is what that test did
# first, and appending a matcher pointed it at the wrong one. A name cannot drift that way.
#
# That "EXCEPT" is load-bearing, not throat-clearing: the unqualified version of this
# sentence is the exact reasoning #440 used to leave the named arm's `?`/`#` admission
# alone ("narrowing it would be a loss, and this class is one-directional"). Read
# unqualified, it re-arms the same trap for the next narrowing this file needs — the
# bar is not "zero loss", it is "the loss is characterized, pinned by its own test, and
# smaller than what leaving it unnarrowed costs".
#
# See the comments at each definition below for why each is shaped as it is.
#
# The password run's character class used to be CONDITIONAL on whether a username was
# present, with the two arms deliberately NOT interchangeable: the named-username arm
# (`://user:…@`) admitted `?` and `#`, while #440's empty-username arm (`://:…@`) excluded
# them because `://:` also serializes an empty host with a port, so admitting them made
# `custom://:8080?email=a@b` — a query string carrying an `@`, no userinfo anywhere — come
# out as `custom://:[redacted: secret value]@b`.
#
# #442 REVERSES that split. Per RFC 3986, `?` and `#` terminate the authority component —
# nothing after either one can be userinfo, so a run containing them can never be a
# password, on EITHER arm. The named arm's `?`/`#` admission was reasoned about as
# "maximal run, narrow only under an established loss" when #438 wrote it, and #440 kept
# that reasoning for the arm it left alone — but the loss it was protecting
# (`x://u:ab?cd@h`, a password containing a literal `?`) is RFC-invalid userinfo already,
# while what admitting them costs is every ordinary URL whose query or fragment carries an
# `@`: `https://host.example:8443?email=user@example.com` masked its port and query as a
# credential, and #443's reorder (below) only widened how much of the query that false
# positive could reach. Weighed against each other, the RFC-invalid password shape is the
# smaller loss, so both arms now share the SAME run — `_CS_PASSWORD_CHARS` below — and the
# conditional that used to pick between them collapses (kept anonymous rather than
# revived: `(?(cs_user)...)`'s two arms are no longer different expressions to pick
# between). `x://u:ab?cd@h` losing its redaction is the accepted, characterized trade
# (see the test pinning it).
#
# #443 enlarged the pre-#442 false positive's reach without changing this class: running
# these matchers first removed an accidental brake, a labelled marker landing inside the
# query used to stop the username arm from matching, so
# `https://host.example:8443?token=<secret>@x.example` kept its port and query. It no
# longer does — and since #445 that no longer depends on position either, candidates are
# collected from the ORIGINAL text. #442 does not undo that enlargement; it removes the
# false positive the enlargement was making worse.
#
# #442 round-2 review: narrowing only the PASSWORD run above was not enough. The
# USERNAME run below admitted `?`/`#` too, and the same RFC 3986 rationale applies to it —
# `https://host.example?foo:bar12345678@x.example` has no userinfo at all, but the
# username slot's un-narrowed class let it consume `host.example?foo` as a "username",
# the `:` as the separator, and `bar12345678` as an RFC-invalid-but-matched password. A
# hand-spelled second `[^:@\s/?#]` here — a THIRD near-copy alongside `_CS_PASSWORD_CHARS`
# and `CONNECTION_STRING_USERNAME_TOKEN_PATTERN`'s own class below — is exactly the drift
# this module's derived-fragment discipline (`_LABEL_ALT`, `_KEY_STEP`/`_KEY_STEP_ANON`)
# exists to rule out, so all three now derive from ONE exclusion set instead.
#
# Characters that terminate ANY connection-string userinfo run, username or password:
# `@` (the userinfo/host boundary, the lookahead terminator elsewhere), whitespace and

# terminators — nothing after either can be userinfo, on EITHER side of the `:`).

# Connection-string userinfo: redact the password between `://[user]:` and `@host`,
# keeping scheme, user, and host. The `@` lookahead avoids matching `host:port`.
#
# The username is OPTIONAL (`*`, not `+`) — `://:password@host` is password-only
# userinfo, and it is the canonical Redis URL rather than an edge case, since Redis
# had no usernames before ACLs in 6.0, so most `REDIS_URL` values still look like
# that. Requiring a username sent those passwords out verbatim (#440). Do not
# restore the `+`: it is the one userinfo form the rest of this pattern already
# handles correctly.
#
# The PASSWORD side stays `+` deliberately. `://user:@host` has an empty password,
# which holds no secret, and matching it would emit a `[redacted]` marker for a
# blank value — claiming to have hidden something that was never there.
#
# The scan starts AT the `://` and never looks left of it. It used to open with a
# scheme run, `[a-zA-Z][\w+.-]*://`, which was quadratic (#438): that greedy class
# holds every character a scheme does, so at each start position it ran to the end
# of the surrounding word and then backtracked one character at a time hunting the
# literal — work repeated at every position of a long run. 100 KB of unbroken text
# took ~15s, and `redact_text` runs on untrusted model output, so a call could hang
# past its deadline on data the caller never wrote. A possessive quantifier does not
# fix it (it drops the backtrack, not the rescan) and bounding the run only trades
# the blowup for a magic constant.
#
# Dropping the scheme costs no coverage, because the scheme was never part of the
# REPLACED span, only of the surrounding match: the old pattern captured it in
# group 1 and the replacement handed it straight back, and the new one leaves it
# outside the match entirely. Either way it survives verbatim, so output is
# byte-identical wherever the old pattern matched — pinned by a differential test
# that runs the old pattern over the new pipeline's output and requires it to find
# nothing. It does recognize strictly more — userinfo whose `://` no letter-led run
# reaches (`://u:pw@h`, `9://u:pw@h`) — which is the safe direction here, and closes
# a real leak: when the labelled pattern's marker had already eaten the scheme
# (`key=<...>://user:pw@host`), the old pattern could no longer match and the
# password went out intact.

# destroys rather than by taste:
#
#   * Only the `:@` shape. A trailing bare colon is a password field that is
#     present and deliberately empty — the token-as-username idiom. The BARE
#     `://token@host` form is left alone at ANY threshold, because length cannot
#     establish credential semantics in that position: a 16+ rule masks
#     `git+ssh://deployment-automation@git.example.com/repo`, `ssh://continuous-
#     integration@build...`, `https://first.last+alerts@example.com`, and
#     `docker://prometheus-operator@sha256:...` (a NAME@DIGEST ref, not userinfo
#     at all) — identities every one. Raising the threshold only changes which
#     identities get destroyed. That position is already covered for every
#     credential shape this module RECOGNIZES, since the vendor patterns match
#     `ghp_`/`AKIA`/`sk-`/`xoxb-` wherever they appear; what remains is a
#     generic opaque string, which is precisely what cannot be told apart from a
#     long username. Leaving it is this module's documented best-effort boundary.
#
#   * The 16-character gate. `:@` alone does not imply a token — RFC 1738 spells
#     `ftp://foo:@host` as username `foo` with an empty password — so an ungated
#     match masks `ftp://anonymous:@host` and `postgres://readonly:@db/app`. 16 is

# above, alongside `_CS_PASSWORD_CHARS`) rather than hand-spelling its own class, so the
# two runs cannot drift onto different exclusion sets again the way username and password
# briefly did across #442's two review rounds.

    #     -> redis://u:token=[redacted: secret value]%2Ftailsegment@host
    #
    # Matching the COMPLETE userinfo span before anything could fragment it closed that, and
    # at the time it had to be an ordering: the defect is a property of the pipeline, not of
    # any one matcher, so no per-pattern tweak reached it. But an ordering only chooses which
    # member of the interference class bites. #445 was the mirror image — the vendor matchers
    # ahead of LABELLED_VALUE_PATTERN rather than behind the userinfo runs — with a narrower
    # value class consuming a PREFIX of a value the labelled pattern covers whole:
    #
    #     token=ghp_<20 chars>-tailsegment -> token=[redacted: secret value]-tailsegment
    #
    # WHY RUNNING THE USERINFO MATCHERS FIRST WAS SAFE, kept because the test it names is
    # still live. Nothing was lost by running them early: a later candidate was either inside
    # the span they replace — where the marker already covered it — or entirely outside it,
    # since `sub` rescanned the whole string on each pass. The remaining case was a candidate
    # STRADDLING the span's boundary, and that could not arise: the boundary characters are
    # the `:` opening the password and the `@` closing it, and no other matcher's REPLACED run
    # contains either. Where a `:` does appear in another matcher's match — `Authorization:`
    # and a labelled key — it sits in the PRESERVED group, never the replaced run.
    #
    # That single property was the whole argument, and it is checked by
    # `test_no_other_matcher_can_straddle_a_userinfo_boundary` rather than asserted here. Under
    # the merge that test is a pattern-class TRIPWIRE rather than the safety argument — a
    # straddling candidate is now merged with the span it crosses, not stranded by it — but
    # resist restating it as a claim about the character CLASSES either way: two successive
    # review rounds caught a broader version of this sentence being false — the password run
    # below admits `:` on purpose (so `postgres://user:p1:p2:p3@host` redacts whole), and the
    # PEM matcher's span contains spaces, so neither "these runs exclude `:`" nor "every value
    # class is a subset of `[A-Za-z0-9._~+/=-]`" is true. The narrow claim is.
    #
    # THE INVARIANT THAT REPLACED THE ORDERING (#445). Each candidate contributes the span it
    # would REPLACE — the text after the preserved group 1, or the whole match when there is
    # no group. Spans are sorted and folded on STRICT overlap, and one marker is emitted per
    # merged interval. Three consequences are load-bearing:
    #
    #   * TOUCHING SPANS DO NOT MERGE. Two candidates that abut emit two markers, which is
    #     byte-for-byte what two successive `re.sub` passes did.
    #   * A PRESERVED PREFIX SURVIVES POSITIONALLY, not because a matcher hands it back:
    #     group 1's text is simply outside every replaced span, so it is copied through from
    #     the original — and it disappears when some OTHER candidate's span covers it, which
    #     is exactly how a wider match now absorbs a narrower one's leftovers.
    #   * THE #421 EXEMPTION IS JUDGED ON THE ORIGINAL LINE, because `finditer` hands
    #     `_is_code_reference` a `match.string` no earlier substitution has touched. That
    #     removes exemptions an earlier marker used to manufacture (a marker's `]` stopped
    #     `_LABEL_LEAD_RE` from reading back to the sensitive word) — the fail-closed
    #     direction, pinned by
    #     `test_exemption_is_judged_against_the_original_line_not_the_accumulator`.
    #
    # Two limits survive the merge unchanged. It cannot repair input that arrives ALREADY
    # fragmented — a marker is not recoverable, so a second pass over old output does not
    # help. And it only closes a credential some single pattern can SPAN: a userinfo value
    # carrying a character both connection-string runs exclude (`/`, or `?`/`#` on the arms
    # that stop there) produces no candidate covering it, so an earlier matcher firing on its
    # prefix still leaves the remainder beside a marker. That residue is #446, tracked
    # separately. The intra-pattern swallow (#436) is likewise untouched: it is one match's
    # own span, and merging spans cannot widen a match.
    #
    # Adding a matcher here no longer reopens #443 for whatever it recognizes, but the
    # sentinel sweep in tests/test_redaction.py still checks its payload set against this list
    # and will fail if you add one, so a new matcher has to be given a payload (or classified

    # ~4x per 2x input — quadratic, and reachable from untrusted model output the same
    # way #438 was (`redact_text` runs on it via `redact_tree`, orchestration.py:127,
    # :234), so a liveness/DoS concern: a sync tool that blows its deadline loses its
    # paid work.

    # Bounding seg1 at 512 caps per-anchor work AND caps how many anchors ever reach

    # 512 (post-`eyJ` characters, so 515 total for the first segment) rather than a
    # tighter bound: real JOSE headers are base64url of compact JSON — typically 20-60
    # chars, ~120 with `kid`/`jku` — so 512 is ~8x generous. The `x5c`

# Code-reference exemption for the labelled pattern (#421)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# LABELLED_VALUE_PATTERN matches any 16+ character identifier run after a `key`/`token`
# label, so ordinary source tripped it — `token = _helper(x)`, `key = OrderedDict()`,
# `idempotency_key: KeyParam = None`. On a review that masked the code under review out
# of the diff and, because any inline mask makes `coverage` partial, downgraded a `pass`
# to `unknown`.
#
# So a match is exempted only when it is provably a code reference rather than a
# credential. Every condition below removes a way a real credential gets written, and
# the exemption applies ONLY to a diff body line in a recognized SOURCE file (see
# DiffRedactor) — never to redact_text's arbitrary prose, and never to config or data,
# where none of this holds. The other patterns still run on an exempted line, so a value
# carrying a recognized vendor/JWT/PEM shape is caught anyway.
#
# The file-type gate is load-bearing, not belt-and-braces. Every condition here is a claim
# about CODE syntax: that an unquoted 16+ character run followed by `(` is an identifier
# being called, not a literal. In YAML, properties, or Markdown the identical text is a
# plain scalar — `key: correcthorsebatterystaple(2024)` is a password containing
# parentheses — and no line-local test can tell the two apart. Worse, YAML nests the
# sensitive label on a PRECEDING line (`secrets:` / `  key: …`), out of reach of any
# same-line scan. So data formats keep redaction unconditionally.

# Extensions whose `label = value` / `label: Type` lines are code. Deliberately a
# whitelist: an unknown extension is treated as data and keeps redaction (fail closed).

    * **A group that is not at the match start** (``AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}(_hint:)…``) puts
      ``end(1)`` in the MIDDLE of the match, so everything before the group — the credential
      itself — is copied through as preserved text while the marker covers only the tail.
    * **A truthy ``lastindex`` with a non-participating group 1**
      (``(?:(pre:)|(alt:))…``, where the second branch matched) gives ``span(1) == (-1, -1)``.
      The projection then carries a negative start, which slices from the wrong end of the
      line: the secret survives whole and a stray marker appears beside it.

    Over-redaction is the safe direction for a secret boundary, so a violating candidate takes
    the WHOLE match rather than being skipped (which would leak) or raising (which would turn
    a redaction pass into an outage on prose it was only meant to mask).

    the plain one (#446) — the authoritative decision point for both, and for the documented

    Neither marker is a proof. The PLAIN marker means this function found no AFFIRMATIVE,
    grammar-level reason to suspect the match stopped short — never that it verified
    completeness, which it structurally cannot: a free-form labelled secret can legitimately
    contain almost any character, including ones the checks below treat as safe. The PARTIAL
    marker means it found such a reason — a follower or leader character the matched
    pattern's own alphabet demonstrably could not have produced. Both checks are heuristic
    hedges, consistent with this module's "best-effort... NOT a guarantee" contract (module
    docstring); where the checks' own mechanics are ambiguous (a tie between candidates —
    see ``_redact_secret_values``'s fold), the tie resolves toward the PARTIAL marker —
    over-hedging, not under-hedging, is the safe direction for a secret boundary. What the
    checks do NOT do is treat every character a value's alphabet excludes as suspect:
    whitespace, a closing quote/bracket, and a comma follow essentially every labelled value
    in ordinary prose, so flagging those too would fire on nearly every redaction and erase
    the signal rather than sharpen it — a deliberate calibration, not an oversight, pinned by
    the boundary characterizations near ``test_a_credential_the_userinfo_runs_cannot_span_
    is_only_partly_redacted``. Either check below is independently sufficient.

    **Trailing**: the character right after the interval exists and is not one of the
    safe-terminator characters for the interval's TRAILING-EDGE CANDIDATE TYPE. An absent
    follower (end of string) is unconditionally treated as no evidence of truncation. Which
    SET of safe terminators applies depends on ``trailing_narrow`` (see the fold in
    ``_redact_secret_values`` for how that is derived across a tie): a LABELLED or Bearer
    trailing edge uses the narrower ``_LABELLED_SAFE_TERMINATORS`` — its value alphabet
    (`_VALUE_CHARS`, or Bearer's RFC 6750 `b64token` character set) is not a specific
    credential's own grammar the way a vendor prefix or userinfo delimiter is, so a character
    it excludes is weaker (but not zero) evidence of a real boundary there — while everything
    else — userinfo/connection-string candidates, and the vendor/JWT/PEM whole-match patterns
    whose classes ARE a specific credential's grammar — uses the wider ``_SAFE_TERMINATORS``.

    **Leading**: the interval's earliest-starting covered candidate is a whole-match one
    (``leading_whole`` — derived the same way as ``trailing_narrow``, across a tie) AND the
    character right before the interval exists and is in the leading-continuation class. A
    whole-match candidate's span start is the true start of what the pattern matched, so a
    continuation character sitting right before it is affirmative evidence the match itself
    began mid-token. A candidate whose span was instead pinned at a preserved group's end (a
    label, `://user:`, `Bearer `) does not carry this evidence — that boundary is deliberate,
    not an artifact of the pattern's own reach — which is why a prefix-preserving candidate is
    excluded rather than merely deprioritized.

    result is a single line by construction. :func:`sanitize_echo_prose` is the variant
    for a multi-line diagnostic.

    ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, and it is strip-then-redact. Redaction is a pattern match over
    contiguous text, so any character wedged into a secret defeats it — a control

    Stripping first only JOINS fragments while the matcher can still see them, so this

    Deletion, not replacement, is what makes that work: substituting a space would leave
    ``sk- ant-api03-...`` still unmatched, and the plaintext would ride out.

    The bound, stated so nothing downstream over-reads it: this closes the split by a BARE

    ``[31m`` behind once the ESC is gone, so the value is still not contiguous and the

    Truncation is deliberately NOT applied here. Callers bound their own echoes, and they

    stderr tail exists to be read; collapsing it into one glued line ("not\\nauthorized"
    -> "notauthorized") destroys the thing it is for.

    Safety is decided, not assumed, and it fails closed. The question a newline raises is
    exactly one: does JOINING the lines reveal a secret that the split text hid? So the
    newline-keeping view is sanitized, its newlines are removed, and the result is offered
    to the redactor once more. If that second pass finds nothing to change, the newlines
    hid nothing and the keeping view is returned. If it finds anything, the newlines were
    load-bearing for a match, and the fully-collapsed view of the ORIGINAL text is
    returned instead — collapsing the original, not the keeping view, is what makes the
    split value contiguous where the matcher can still see the whole run.

    The narrower question matters: an "are the two views identical" test would collapse
    far more often than safety needs, because collapsing lines lets a value run continue

class DiffRedactor:
    """Incremental, line-oriented secret redactor for a unified diff. Carries the
    per-file skip state across calls so it can be driven over a streamed diff (one
    logical line at a time) without materializing the whole text. ``feed`` returns
    zero or more output lines for the given input line. Mirrors ``redact`` exactly.

    REQUIRES a diff in git's standard format, where every file's body is preceded by its
    own ``diff --git`` header: the per-file state (whether to skip the hunk, and whether
    the file is source for the #421 code exemption) is set from that header and persists
    until the next one. Both start closed on a fresh instance, so a headerless stream is
    redacted conservatively — but feeding file B's body without B's header would judge it
    under file A's verdict. Every caller here passes output straight from ``git diff`` or
    ``git show``, which always emits the headers.

    ``redacted`` stays the single encounter-ordered union of every touched path — the
    same list this class has always exposed, kept for callers that only need "was this
    file touched" (``redact()``, ``meta.redacted_paths``). ``withheld_paths`` and
    ``masked_paths`` split that union into WHOLE-FILE drops (the file path itself looked
    secret-bearing) vs files that were sent with one or more inline values replaced
    (#433); the two are DISJOINT, and WITHHOLDING IS DOMINANT BOTH WAYS (#433 review
    C2/C3, sharpened by Copilot review of #470 comment 5): a path can reach the
    identical target string via a LATER ``diff --git`` header, e.g. a rename target
    (``_diff_path_from_header`` resolves to the rename's "b/" side for both the rename
    header and any later plain header naming that same path), in either order —
    - withhold, then a later mask attempt: the mask counts NOWHERE (bumps
      ``inline_masks`` by nothing, never lists the path in ``masked_paths``);
    - mask (committed), then a later withhold: the path MOVES from ``masked_paths`` to
      ``withheld_paths``, and its already-committed contribution is subtracted back
      out of ``inline_masks`` — leaving it masked-only after a later withhold would
      OVER-CLAIM coverage the file no longer has, the unsafe direction.
    Either way ``redacted`` never gains a duplicate entry, and the marker still reaches
    the returned OUTPUT text regardless of which list (if any) ends up naming the path
    — the text is not the disclosure. Each list otherwise preserves its own encounter
    order. ``inline_masks`` counts the total EMITTED replacement markers across every
    KNOWN, currently-non-withheld masked file — see ``_redact_secret_values`` for why
    that differs from a raw candidate-match count; a match on a body line seen before
    any ``diff --git`` header (headerless stream) is still redacted in the returned
    text but counted nowhere, since there is no path to attribute it to.

    ``feed``'s ``track`` parameter (default ``True``) decides whether ``withheld_paths``/
    ``masked_paths``/``inline_masks`` — NOT ``.redacted``, see below — are updated
    IMMEDIATELY within the same call. ``track=False`` computes the identical OUTPUT
    text but only STAGES the event; the caller must call ``commit_pending()`` to apply
    it, or let the NEXT ``feed()`` call silently discard it. A byte-capped accumulator
    (``gitdiff._BoundedDiffAccumulator``) uses this: ``masked_paths``/``inline_masks``
    describe files SENT with a value replaced, so an event whose output line(s) end up
    in the DROPPED tail past the byte cap must not be recorded there, or the disclosure
    would claim content the model never saw (#433 review C2). ``.redacted`` is
    DELIBERATELY exempt from this gating — it has never had a byte-cap-aware notion of
    "sent," and #433's own brief requires ``meta.redacted_paths``/``DryRunResult.
    redacted_paths`` (both read it) stay byte-for-byte what they always were; it is
    still deduped against itself the same way regardless of ``track``. This means
    ``.redacted`` can be a STRICT SUPERSET of ``withheld_paths`` union ``masked_paths``
    under truncation — a path can be in the legacy union (something in the FULL
    stream looked secret-bearing) without appearing in either new list (nothing about
    it survived the byte cap); ``orchestration.build_coverage`` relies on exactly this
    split (#433 review C1) to still flag ``partial``/``"redacted"`` from the legacy
    union while leaving the structured ``redaction`` disclosure ``None`` rather than
    fabricating a breakdown of content nobody can see."""
