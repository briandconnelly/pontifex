"""Orphan sweep: reclaim processes that survive a process-group kill.

Regression coverage for the M0-7 finding. kimi's Bash tool spawns each command in its OWN
process group, reparented to init, so `killpg` on kimi's group leaves those children
running indefinitely. Verified on kimi-code 0.35.0: after killing kimi's group (pid 3816),
a `sleep 240` survived as pid 3828 / pgid 3828 / ppid 1.

These tests spawn a plain shell rather than kimi — the defect is about process topology, not
about kimi — so they run without the CLI and without model spend.
