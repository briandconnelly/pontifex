"""Prompt framing: byte-parity with the source bridges, and builder behavior.

The parity fixtures below are copied VERBATIM from moonbridge's prompts.py
(byte-identical to codex-in-claude's after the host-name substitution). They
pin the M2/M3 guarantee: a consumer passing host_name="Claude Code" reproduces
its current wire prose exactly — if these fail, the migration would change what
the model sees.
