# --- #438: the connection-string scan starts at `://` ------------------------
# The pattern used to scan the SCHEME with an unbounded greedy `[a-zA-Z][\w+.-]*`
# ahead of the `://` literal. That run went to the end of every non-`/` stretch at
# every start position and then backtracked hunting the literal, which is quadratic
# and reachable from untrusted model output (redact_text/redact_tree). The scheme was
# never part of the REDACTED span — the old pattern captured it in group 1 and the
# replacement handed it straight back, and the new one leaves it outside the match
# entirely — so the scan now begins at `://`. Two consequences are pinned below: no
# password the old pattern redacted stops being redacted, and userinfo the old pattern
# could not reach is now covered.

# The pre-#438 pattern, kept as an ORACLE. The invariant that matters for a secret
# boundary is one-directional — anchoring may recognize MORE, never less — and the only
# way to test that is against the thing being replaced, so it is spelled out here rather
# than imported. Comparing against the old PATTERN on the raw line, rather than against
# the old pipeline's output, is deliberately the stricter check: an earlier pattern in
# the list may have already consumed the value, and the assertion below holds either way.

# that matter here; random text essentially never generates a well-formed userinfo.
#
# Do NOT add a `?`/`#`-carrying value to EITHER `_USERS` or `_PASSWORDS` below (e.g.
# `"u?v"`, `"p?w"`, `"p#w"`) to widen either slot's coverage. `_all_lines()` feeds every
# combination through BOTH #438/#440-era oracles (`_PRE_438_CONNECTION_PATTERN`,
# `_PRE_440_CONNECTION_PATTERN`), which still admit `?`/`#` in EITHER position — #442
# deliberately stopped the LIVE matcher from doing so, on the password side in round 1
# (`test_password_containing_a_raw_query_or_fragment_char_is_the_accepted_442_loss` pins
# it) and on the username side in round 2
# (`test_username_containing_a_raw_query_or_fragment_char_is_the_accepted_442_loss`) — so
# a `?`/`#` value in either slot would make both oracles report every one of that shape's
# generated lines as a leftover: the PINNED, CHARACTERIZED #442 trade, misread by this
# sweep as a regression. Verified directly rather than asserted: adding `"u?v"` to
# `_USERS` alone (leaving every other slot as committed) made this sweep's grammar produce
# 297/19200 leftovers against the #438 oracle and 360/19200 against the #440 oracle — the
# same blindness class round 1's version of this warning already documented for

# position scans the unbounded first segment to the end of the run and
# backtracks hunting a `.` that is never there — quadratic, and reachable from
# untrusted model output the same way #438 was (`redact_text` via `redact_tree`,
# both called from `orchestration.py`).
#
# One repeated-anchor (seed, reps) pair per LIVE pattern, keyed on the pattern's
# own compiled source (the `_WHITESPACE_ONLY_SOURCES` keying discipline) rather
# than list position, so a pattern added later fails the
# completeness guard below loudly instead of silently going unmeasured. ~80k
# chars is enough to demonstrate liveness for every pattern except JWT: on this
# machine `"eyJ"*26666` (~80k, the #439 issue's own example) measured 1.56s —
# under the 2.0s budget. A smaller JWT rep count (35000, ~2.8s old) was tried
# first and rejected: only ~1.4x over the 2.0s budget, so a moderately faster
# runner could pass the quadratic implementation and the test would stop
# demonstrating the property its name claims. `"eyJ"*90000` (270k chars) was
# measured instead (old pattern swapped in temporarily, never committed;
# three runs: 17.887s/17.220s/18.196s old, 0.0949s/0.0884s/0.0924s fixed) —
# the old pattern lands at ~8.6-9.1x over budget on every run, comfortably
# above an 8x floor, while the fixed pattern stays at ~21-23x margin under it.

    (that map's seed for this pattern) carries no bracket anywhere, so `key_bracket` is
    false at every anchor and guard 1 never evaluates there. This is the seed that DOES
    reach it: a text built from repeated BRACKETED anchors.

    Flat for a structural reason, not a numeric one (see `_SWALLOW_GUARD_PEEK`'s module
    comment): `key_bracket` requires consuming a quote and a `]`, both outside
    `_VALUE_CHARS`, so guard 1's unbounded probe run from one bracketed anchor is always
    terminated before the next bracketed anchor begins — no probe run can span two
    anchors, so per-anchor cost cannot compound. Measured on this machine:
    5000 reps (50k chars) 0.007s, 10000 (100k) 0.014s, 20000 (200k) 0.029s, 40000
    (400k) 0.057s — linear, ~2x per 2x input, comfortably under the 2.0s budget with
    room to spare (Kimi's own prototype measured 0.032s/0.043s at ~220k/270k chars on a

#     empty — the token-as-username idiom (Stripe's `https://sk_test_x:@api...`).
#     But it does NOT by itself imply a token: RFC 1738 spells `ftp://foo:@host`
#     as username `foo` with an empty password, so an UNGATED match on this shape
#     masks `ftp://anonymous:@host` and `postgres://readonly:@db/app`.
#   * The length gate is what separates those. 16 is not a new constant — it is
#     already this file's credential threshold, in `LABELLED_VALUE_PATTERN`.
#
# The BARE `://token@host` form is deliberately NOT matched, at any threshold.
# Length cannot establish credential semantics in that position: a 16+ gate masks
# `git+ssh://deployment-automation@git.example.com/repo` (a documented pip VCS
# URL), `ssh://continuous-integration@build.example.com`, `docker://prometheus-
# operator@sha256:...` (a NAME@DIGEST ref, not userinfo at all), and the email
# `https://first.last+alerts@example.com` — every one an identity, none a secret.
# Raising the threshold only changes which identities get destroyed. That position
# is already covered for every credential shape this module RECOGNIZES — the
# vendor patterns match `ghp_`/`AKIA`/`sk-`/`xoxb-` there regardless of position —
# so the residue is a generic opaque string, which is exactly what cannot be told
# apart from a long username. Leaving it is this module's documented best-effort
# boundary, not an oversight.
#

# --- #443: an earlier marker must not fragment a connection-string credential -
# `SECRET_VALUE_PATTERNS` is applied in order, one `re.sub` pass per pattern, and `sub`
# never revisits consumed text. When a substring-oriented matcher fired INSIDE a
# connection-string password, its marker — which contains a space and a colon — split the
# credential in two, and the connection-string runs stop at whitespace, so they could no
# longer match it. The tail shipped intact, behind a marker claiming the value was handled:
#
#     redis://u:token=s3cr3tvalue0123456789%2Ftailsegment@host
#     -> redis://u:token=[redacted: secret value]%2Ftailsegment@host
#
# #443 fixed that by running both connection-string matchers FIRST, so the complete userinfo
# span was consumed before anything could fragment it — a property of the ordered pipeline
# rather than of any one matcher, which is why no regex changed. #445 then replaced the
# ordering itself: the engine collects every pattern's candidate spans against the ORIGINAL
# text and merges the overlapping ones, so no matcher can consume text out from under another
# at all. The sweep BODY below is unchanged and still guards the same property — the loop, the
# corpus, and the assertion are as #443 wrote them; only its signature grew an `engine`
# parameter for the conversion below. What changed is that the property now holds for reasons
# that do not depend on this list's order, which is why the control substitutes the pre-#445
# ENGINE rather than the pre-#443 ordering.
#
# The instrument is a SENTINEL sweep, not the old-pattern oracle the #438/#440 sweeps use.
# That oracle is structurally incapable of seeing this bug: the regexes are unchanged, so an
# old-pattern oracle and the live matcher agree by construction, and — the deeper reason —
# the old pipeline cannot recognize its OWN partially redacted output, because the marker
# destroys the syntax the oracle needs in order to match. Every credential generated below
# therefore carries a unique tail that no matcher recognizes on its own; the assertion is
# that the tail disappears. The pre-#445 sequential engine, driven over the pre-#443 ordering
# — the exact pipeline that shipped the bug — is kept as the control.

    connection-string matchers first was safe because a later candidate was either inside the
    span they replace (covered by the marker) or wholly outside it (`sub` rescans the whole
    string). The only dangerous case was a candidate STRADDLING the boundary — and the
    boundary characters are the `:` that opens the password run and the `@` that closes it. So
    the invariant was that no other matcher's REPLACED run may contain either.

    It belongs to the OTHER matchers, not to the connection-string ones: the password run
    admits `:` on purpose, so `postgres://user:p1:p2:p3@host` is redacted whole (pinned by
    `test_connection_string_password_with_colons_redacted`). A comment in `redaction.py`
    asserted the opposite and was corrected after a review caught it; this test exists so the
    argument is checked rather than narrated, and so a future matcher whose replaced run
    admits `:` or `@` fails here instead of quietly invalidating it.

    Scope, stated because this is corpus evidence rather than a proof over each matcher's whole
    language: it can only judge a matcher on the spans it actually produces here. What closes
    that gap is the per-pattern liveness assertion below — every matcher must FIRE on this
    corpus — together with the completeness guard, which already forces each one to have a
    payload embedded in these lines. A matcher that escaped this check would first have to fail
    that one. (An earlier mutation probe for this test added a matcher that never fired, so the
    guard passed while inspecting nothing; the liveness assertion is what that probe bought.)

    The reorder closes every shape the connection-string matchers can SPAN. A credential
    carrying a character those runs exclude was never matchable by them in the first place —
    ordering cannot help — so an earlier matcher firing on its prefix still leaves the
    remainder beside a marker. #446 does not close that miss — no pattern can produce a
    candidate covering the excluded character, so the value is still only partly replaced —
    it closes the DISHONESTY of the marker claiming otherwise. Each follower here (`%`, `/`,
    `?`) is not one of the safe-terminator characters the trailing check treats as proof the
    value ended, so the emitted marker is `[redacted: possibly partial secret value]` rather
    than the plain one: the reader can no longer conclude the credential was fully handled from
    the marker alone. This is the trailing half of #446 (a leading-continuation miss is

    to the plain (complete-claiming) one.

    The miss itself remains this module's documented best-effort boundary: no merge can widen
    a single matcher's span, so a userinfo credential carrying `/` (or, on the arms that stop
    there, `?`/`#`) is never fully redacted by this pipeline. #446's fix does not repair that —
    it cannot, the excluded character is still unreachable — it only stops the output from
    claiming completeness it does not have. #446's fixer CONVERTED this test rather than
    deleting it, retiring the now-vacuous pre-#443-order monkeypatch half along with it (under

# pass without exercising the projection at all — the same "passes against the bug it guards"
# trap `_PROBES` exists for. Each test asserts the malformed pattern really does violate the
# assumption before asserting the output, so a probe that drifted into well-formedness fails
# loudly instead of going vacuous.

# the wedge an attacker controls: a repository under review can make an agent CLI print
# chosen text on stderr, and that stderr is echoed into an error envelope. So an echoed
# span is stripped of control characters FIRST, then redacted. The reverse order has a
# mirror-image failure — redaction leaves the split secret alone, and stripping afterwards
# reassembles it contiguous in the outgoing message.
