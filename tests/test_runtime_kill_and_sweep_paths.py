"""Kill/sweep paths of runtime that the bridges exercise through their own suites.

In the source repos these lines were reached via consumer-level tests (delegate
runs, worker cancellation). The standalone library covers them directly: the
public ``kill_process_tree`` contract and ``run_async``'s orphan sweep on the
timeout, cancellation, and success paths.
